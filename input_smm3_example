# seven values given here, which are:
# 1. polynomial value for the DC fit. 3-4 is usually good enough
# 2. precision of the periodogram(m) 
# 3-4. window of periodogram, minimum minH(m) 
# 5. ediff - how much the min/max elevation angles should vary from window (degrees)
# 6-7. noise values of periodogram (min value, meters)

# elmin elmax and emin/emax for polyfit to remove direct signal
# In this example I am only using 5-15 degrees but for normal 2-3 meter
# tall sites, I would recommend using 5-25 or 5-30. The polynomial fit is usually
# 5-30

# azimuth ranges you will examine (begin and end) 
# they are read in pairs - so 45-90 and then 90-135 etc etc

# frequency followed by amplitude required to be reported as significant
# 1 is GPS L1
# 5 is GPS L5
# 2 is generic GPS L2, which for some receivers can be problematic.
# 20 means L2C signal for the current satellite list
# 101 and 102 are glonass 
# 201 ... for galileo
# 302 etc ... beidou
# # these values are quite large- appropriate for ice.  you can go smaller.

# seven values given here, which are:
# 1. polynomial value for the DC fit. 3-4 is usually good enough
# 2. precision of the periodogram(m) 
# 3-4. window of periodogram, minimum minH(m) 
# 5. ediff - how much the min/max elevation angles should vary from window (degrees)
# 6-7. noise values of periodogram (min value, meters)
# Note that in this example we had to extend the default RH region because this 
# site is in fact 16 meters tall.
